#web-historian

A simple webpage archiver using a basic node server. A cronjob saves webpages
entered by the user on a regular schedule, and saved to a local file system.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
Hack Reactor's curriculum. This project was worked on with a pair; it's 
representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled, but not of my solo work.
